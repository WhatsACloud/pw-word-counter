Despite Singapore’s “War on Salt”, 9 in 10 residents still exceed the recommended daily limit of 2,000mg of sodium (one teaspoon). From 2010 to 2023, average sodium per dish rose by 22%, mirroring a rise in daily intake from 3,480mg (2019) to 3,620mg (2022) (Ganesan, 2023).
Excess sodium is a major risk for chronic diseases like hypertension, which nearly doubled from 19.8% in 2010 to 35.5% in 2019–2020 (Tan, 2024; Changi General Hospital, 2023). Long-term high intake also harms the kidney, heart, blood vessels and brain, increasing the risk of fatal events such as heart attack and stroke (Singapore Heart Foundation, 2024). Addressing high sodium consumption is therefore critical.

Aim(s) of Project


To reduce excessive sodium consumption among office workers.


Target Group of Project & Rational

Our target group is office workers, with a median age of 45 (MOM, 2024), who are particularly vulnerable to sodium-related illnesses due to sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating habits (Chaudhary et al., 2024). Long hours at desks, limited physical activity, and dependence on convenient meals make them more prone to health risks.
This vulnerability increases with age, as sodium sensitivity rises sharply in midlife. Each 2,300 mg/day increase in sodium raises systolic blood pressure by 4.8 mmHg in adults aged 40–44, compared to just 3.2–3.7 mmHg in younger adults (Xiao et al., 2022). While many are aware that sodium raises the risk of hypertension, fewer realise it also increases the chances of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and kidney failure even in the short term (Hao et al., 2022). Moreover, optimism bias leads many to believe these illnesses will only occur later in life, reducing their motivation to act (Taehwan et al., 2021). Hence, there is a need to raise awareness of the immediate and severe health effects of high sodium intake.
Tracking sodium intake is also difficult. Many workers misjudge sodium sources, find food labels confusing, and struggle with daily intake calculations (International Food Information Council, 2024). With limited time, they often choose hawker or fast food, underestimating sodium from sauces and seasonings like soy sauce (Khalik, 2024). Hence, a convenient platform is needed to monitor sodium intake and promote healthier, lower-sodium alternatives.

Proposed Ideas & Rationale
Brief description of proposed ideas
Analysis of how proposed ideas address the project aim(s) and the needs of the target group
Justify proposed ideas using research findings and evaluate proposed ideas for their strengths and limitations


Our project adopts the EC framework (Fig. 1) to address the problem of excessive sodium consumption among office workers. We aim to Educate them about the health risks of high sodium intake through our awareness campaign, LESS SODIUM, LESS PAIN. To Counter the difficulty of monitoring sodium consumption, we aim to launch a sodium tracker app that helps users log meals, calculate sodium intake, and discover nearby lower-sodium food options.

Main organiser: 
Our campaign supports healthier workplace habits through better food choices and health awareness, aligning with HPB’s “War on Salt” to reduce population sodium intake by 15% by 2026 through public education and lower-sodium alternatives (HPB, 2023). It complements existing efforts to bring healthier meals, screenings, and wellness activities to worksites to create supportive environments (HPB).

 Strategy 1: Less Salt, Less Pain Campaign
This campaign installs iPads near CBD hawker centres (Fig. 2), targeting the high foot traffic of 284,000 office workers in the area (Office Finder Team, 2021). Hawker centres are known for their salty dishes (Chia, 2024), and are conveniently located near workplaces, offering a wide range of local foods (Singapore AI News, 2025). The interactive platform educates users on sodium-related health risks, encouraging reduced intake and addressing the root cause of excessive sodium consumption

Customisation of profile lifestyle 
The iPads will function as kiosks where an AI chatbot asks about age, medical conditions, gender, race, marital status, and children to tailor health feedback based on the user’s profile (Fig. 3).
A chatbot was chosen to provide personalised analysis of salt’s impact, as these factors affect susceptibility to sodium-related diseases (Corliss, 2024). A speech-to-text feature will enhance accuracy and convenience, allowing users to speak instead of type their responses (Vibhandik, 2025).

Calculated risk of illnesses due to diet

The chatbot prompts users for dietary details such as meal frequency, food sources, and typical dishes to estimate sodium intake and personalise health risks. It compares their intake to the recommended daily limit of 2000 mg and uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to calculate the likelihood of sodium-related illnesses (Yi et al., 2020).

Results of calculated risk of sodium related illnesses
The platform shows users’ sodium intake on a bar, along with risks of conditions like kidney failure and strokes when limits are exceeded (Fig. 5). It also estimates how each sodium increase raises illness risk for example, cardiovascular disease risk rises by up to 6% per 1g increase (Wang, 2020), helping counter optimism bias about personal health risks.

Review of sodium related illnesses
Users can click buttons to explore each health issue through comic strips (Fig. 6), which effectively communicate complex health information and are especially helpful for those with low health literacy (Pagès et al., 2021). Generated by the AI chatbot based on user responses, the comics present personalised narratives showing both current and near-future health impacts, using fear as a strong motivator to encourage healthier sodium habits (Anakpo, 2024).

Promotion of LessSalt app

Completing the activity boosts motivation to reduce sodium intake and encourages office workers to download the LessSalt app (Fig. 7).

Limitation

The wide variety and convenience of hawker options in Singapore cause office workers to frequently eat out and vary their food choices, making sodium intake inconsistent and unpredictable (Tan, 2018). This fluctuation affects the accuracy of sodium risk assessment by the AI chatbot. Hence, to enhance precision, we could improve reliability by asking users to select a typical range of foods they consume daily, allowing the chatbot to estimate intake more accurately over time.


Strategy 2: LessSalt app
Unlike generic applications, LessSalt is purpose-built for Singapore’s multicultural food landscape, offering sodium estimates for local favourites such as laksa, chicken rice, and nasi lemak to ensure higher accuracy (Suraya, 2024). It also establishes personalised daily sodium limits by factoring in user characteristics like age, weight, and medical history. Furthermore, it employs advanced AI for real-time food scanning, enabling precise sodium assessment and tailored dietary suggestions (Ryu et al., 2024).
Personalisation
During app setup, users enter personal details such as meal frequency, age, and typical cuisine (Fig. 8). The app then calculates a recommended sodium limit per meal and offers tailored lower-sodium food options. Personalized nutrition interventions are more effective than generic ones in changing salt intake (Moralis et al., 2017).

App homepage
The app’s homepage displays total sodium intake on a bar (Fig. 9), with green indicating intake below the recommended limit and red showing excess. Visual feedback like progress bars promotes self-monitoring and behavior change (Carins et al., 2023). The top of the page shows users’ streaks—the number of consecutive days they have logged sodium intake—which encourages consistency and adherence to sodium limits (Gajbhyie, 2024).

Widgets 
Our app includes home screen widgets (Fig. 10) that display key data like sodium consumed and remaining daily allowance, helping users monitor intake easily. Widgets provide quick access to important features directly from the home screen (Sorrel, 2024).

Camera + AI 
After buying meals, users scan their food with the app’s camera (Fig. 11). The AI identifies items, estimates portions, and calculates nutrients using a database. It shows sodium per ingredient and total per dish, with up to 99% accuracy overall and 80% for sodium when images are clear (Shonkoff, 2023).
Fig. 11 AI Food scanner


The barcode scanner provides exact sodium data for prepacked foods (Fig. 12). The AI then suggests lower-sodium alternatives or portion adjustments based on the scanned item's sodium content to help users reduce intake.

Meal alternatives
The app helps users plan meals within their personalized Meal Sodium Limit and sends reminders before mealtime. Users input preferences like location and ingredients, enabling tailored, lower-sodium suggestions that rotate daily for variety and enjoyment (Fig. 13) (Rolls et al., 2025). For example, Yong Tau Foo with no sauce is a lower-sodium alternative to fishball noodles. Incorporating user preferences and cultural context improves engagement and adherence (Khan et al., 2023).

Limitation 

Despite promotional efforts, users may be reluctant to download the low-salt app due to inconvenience, limited awareness, or lack of immediate benefits. Studies show that digital health apps often face low uptake when users do not perceive a clear personal advantage (Huangfu et al., 2024). In addition, “app fatigue” may reduce interest in new health tools (Sala et al., 2022). To improve adoption rates, we could introduce consistent incentives, such as grocery vouchers, offering tangible and recurring benefits that encourage meaningful uptake.
